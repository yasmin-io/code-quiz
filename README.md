# Code Quiz

At some point, every coder has to complete a coding assessment.'Code Quiz' is a quiz game on JavaScript Fundamentals and you are supposed to beat the time to finish all the questions. This was a challenging project, alongside experimenting and familiarising myself with [Web API's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code, I have created a responsive webpage to showcase my current level of skills.

> **Note:** This website currently isn't optimised for mobile use. This application will run smoothly on your web browser.

## Tasks

- The quiz starts when you click a 'start' button
- The user is presented with a timer
- Once you answer a question, you are presented with a new one
- When you answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the timer
- When all the questions are answered or when the timer reaches o, the game must end
- The user can submit their initials and score

## Future Tests (Bugs & Fixes)

I attempted all of the features mentioned below, however I was extremely concious of time and what was reasonable for me to achieve within a certain period of time.

### Highscore Board

I had completed the code for a score board however, I found it extremely difficult to print from the local storage onto a list that would be present as the 'highscore board'. I wanted features such as: A nav bar link to direct the use to the high score board, a 'clear board' button to remove all past saves and 'initials submit' button that would allow the user to save their name as what they please.

This will be the next thing I work on for this project, to add a highscore feature that is responsive and user friendly.

### Scoring

Due to being time concious, I was also wary about about well the functionality would be for a clean scoring system to add to the highscore board. Adding a feature where each score you win, you multiply that by a smaller number to make the game more interesting and fun for the user. It would be more intriguing, rather than a regular score out of 4, which brings me to my last point.

### Length

I like the idea of having a game that is quick and puts the player on their toes to guess the answers as fast as possible to beat the time. However, I dislike the idea that my game is only 4 questions. So this will also be a future update to the code quiz game.

> These are all updates I want to make to my quiz to allow the user to get more out of their expereince and to help further my knowledge in the requirements in building applications similar.
