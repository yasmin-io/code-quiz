# Code Quiz

At some point, every coder has to complete a coding assessment.'Code Quiz' is a quiz game on JavaScript Fundamentals and you are supposed to beat the time to finish all the questions. This was a challenging project, alongside experimenting and familiarising myself with ![Web API's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code, I have created a responsive webpage to showcase my current level of skills.
